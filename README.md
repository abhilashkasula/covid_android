# covid_android

The challenge I have faced when I'm working from home is to track the covid status in India. In order to keep track of the covid status, I used to tune tv channels or surf google. The theme of this app came from there, what if we create a platform where everyon can look all the stats very easily and will get educated about the outside status.

App Includes:
  - Overall India cases
  - States with respective overall states' cases
  - Districts with respective cases
  - A search option to search any state
  
```Note: Using https://api.covid19india.org for all the covid data.```
